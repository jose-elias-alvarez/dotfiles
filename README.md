# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, fish, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development
on macOS (M1).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest option for macOS.

- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), which does most of what I
  want out-of-the-box and makes customization approachable

- Neovim on its [master branch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)
  with a functional TypeScript setup for its built-in LSP, for programming,
  writing, Git operations, and (almost) everything else I do on the command line

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) +
  [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) to manage sessions

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a lean terminal file manager

## GUI

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to remap
  keys

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management (no
  space management on M1 yet)

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard shortcuts
  (and controlling yabai)
