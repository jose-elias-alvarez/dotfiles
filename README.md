# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development on
macOS.

## Terminal

I use [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), which is faster than
iTerm2 to the point that I don't have a choice.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
- [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

- Neovim + what I consider a reasonable number of plugins, most notably
  [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), which single-handedly makes
  Vim into the ideal TypeScript development environment

- tmux + [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to manage
  sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use git

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a leaner vifm alternative with a
  solid Vim plugin

## macOS

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard shortcuts
  (and controlling yabai)

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to
  remap keys

- [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) for most browsing
  (and Firefox with [Vimium
  C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) when I have to
  log in)
