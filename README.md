# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development on
macOS.

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest option for macOS
(as long as you're careful about enabling GPU rendering).

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
- [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

- Neovim + what I consider a reasonable number of plugins, most notably
  [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), which single-handedly makes
  Vim into the ideal TypeScript development environment

- tmux + a select number of plugins (try
  [extrakto](https://github.com/laktak/extrakto) if you haven't)

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use git

- [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm), not the fastest Vim-like file manager,
  but certainly the most Vim-like option

## macOS

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard shortcuts
  (and controlling yabai)

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to
  remap keys (imagine living without caps lock to escape on press, control on
  hold)

- [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) with a simple yabai rule for
  quick edits (since Neovim + plugins is heavy)

- [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) for most browsing
  (and Firefox with [Vimium
  C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) when I have to
  log in)
