# dotfiles

My dotfiles for VS Code, Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web
development on macOS.

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest option for macOS.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

- Neovim + a few plugins for in-terminal edits

- tmux + [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to manage
  sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use git

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a faster vifm alternative

## macOS

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to
  remap keys (imagine living without caps lock to escape on press, control on
  hold)
