# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, fish, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development on
macOS (M1).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest option for macOS.

- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

- Neovim on its [master branch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)
  with a functional TypeScript setup for its built-in LSP

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) +
  [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) to manage sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use git

- [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm), not the fastest Vim-like file manager,
  but certainly the most Vim-like one

## GUI

- Firefox with [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), the most
  reasonable compromise I've found between having to use (and develop) modern
  websites and wanting keyboard control
