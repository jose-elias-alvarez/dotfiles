# dotfiles

My dotfiles for VS Code, Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web
development on macOS.

## VS Code

I use most of the basic webdev extensions + the [Vim
extension](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) with a handful of bindings.

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest (though not
the fastest) terminal emulator for macOS.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
  [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

- Neovim + a few plugins for in-terminal edits

- tmux + [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to manage
  sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way
  to use git

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a faster vifm alternative

## macOS

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard
  shortcuts (and controlling yabai)

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to
  remap otherwise useless keys

- [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) for most browsing
  (and Firefox with [Vimium
  C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) when I have to
  log in)
