# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development on
macOS.

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest (though not
the fastest) terminal emulator for macOS.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
- [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

- Neovim + a (finally!) functional TypeScript setup for its built-in LSP

- tmux + [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to manage
  sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use git

- [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm), not the fastest Vim-like file manager,
  but certainly the most Vim-like one

## macOS

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard shortcuts
  (and controlling yabai)

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to
  remap keys

- [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) for most browsing
  (and Firefox with [Vimium
  C](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) when I have to
  log in)
